        <p>Flexible Drive Agencies P/L (FDA) is committed to respecting your right to privacy and protecting
          your personal information. We are bound by the Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988

          applicable laws and codes affecting your personal information. Our staff is trained to respect your
          privacy in accordance with our standards, policies and procedures.</p>
        <h4>About this Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information. It also describes generally the
          sorts of personal information held and for what purposes, and how that information is collected,
          held, used and disclosed. Our Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us whether at one of
          our branches, through our call centres or via our websites. We encourage you to check our websites
          regularly for any updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h4>Collecting your personal information</h4>

          number or other information the Company considers necessary. We will, if it is reasonable or
          practicable to do so, collect your personal information from you. This may happen when you fill out
          a product or service application or an administrative form (eg a change of address form), or when
          you give us personal information over the telephone or counter, or through FDA's website. In certain
          cases we collect your personal information from third parties.</p>
        <h4>Using and disclosing your personal information</h4>
